                <div class="faq-question">Q. How Do I Know If My Roof Has Storm Damage? <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                <div class="faq-answer"><h3>How Do I Know If My Roof Has Storm Damage?</h3>
                    <p>After a severe storm, your roof may have damage that isn’t immediately visible. High winds, hail, heavy rain, and falling debris can all weaken your roof, leading to leaks, structural issues, and long-term problems. Recognizing the signs of storm damage early can help prevent costly repairs down the line.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Common Signs of Storm Damage on Your Roof</h4>
                    <p>Here’s what to look for after a storm:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🌪 <strong>Missing or Lifted Shingles</strong> – Strong winds can tear shingles off your roof or loosen them, exposing your home to leaks.</li>
                        <li>💦 <strong>Water Leaks & Stains</strong> – Check your ceilings and attic for water spots, mold, or damp insulation—these are signs of a roof leak.</li>
                        <li>🛑 <strong>Hail Damage (Dents & Bruising)</strong> – Hail can bruise asphalt shingles, causing granule loss and weakening their ability to protect your home.</li>
                        <li>🔩 <strong>Damaged Flashing or Roof Edges</strong> – Wind and hail can bend or loosen flashing around chimneys, vents, and skylights, leading to potential leaks.</li>
                        <li>🌿 <strong>Debris on the Roof</strong> – Branches, leaves, or other debris can cause impact damage, punctures, or clogged gutters.</li>
                        <li>🏚 <strong>Granule Loss in Gutters</strong> – If you notice excessive shingle granules in your gutters, it could mean your shingles are wearing down prematurely.</li>
                        <li>📏 <strong>Sagging or Structural Issues</strong> – If your roof appears uneven, sagging, or has visible cracks, it may have suffered serious storm damage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Why You Should Schedule a Professional Roof Inspection</h4>
                    <p>Not all storm damage is visible from the ground. Even if your roof looks fine, underlying issues may worsen over time, leading to leaks, mold growth, and costly repairs. A professional roof inspection can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Identify Hidden Damage</strong> – Trained roofers spot subtle damage that homeowners might miss.</li>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Prevent Costly Repairs</strong> – Catching damage early helps avoid bigger, more expensive problems later.</li>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Simplify Insurance Claims</strong> – If you need to file a claim, a professional inspection provides documentation for your insurance company.</li>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Ensure Your Home is Protected</strong> – Even minor damage can weaken your roof’s structure, leaving it vulnerable to future storms.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="faq-question">Q. Can storm damage be covered by insurance? <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                <div class="faq-answer"> <h3>Can Storm Damage Be Covered by Insurance?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, in most cases, storm damage to your roof is covered by homeowners insurance, but coverage depends on your policy and the cause of the damage. If your roof has been affected by hail, high winds, heavy rain, or fallen debris, your insurance company may pay for roof repairs or a full replacement—as long as the damage is documented and filed correctly.</p>
                    
                    <h4>When Does Insurance Cover Roof Storm Damage?</h4>
                    <p>Most standard homeowners insurance policies cover unexpected and sudden damage caused by storms, including:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Hail Damage</strong> – Dents, cracks, and granule loss on shingles caused by hail impact.</li>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Wind Damage</strong> – Missing, torn, or lifted shingles due to high winds.</li>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Water Damage (From Storms)</strong> – Leaks caused by roof damage during heavy rainfall.</li>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Fallen Trees & Debris</strong> – Structural damage from trees or debris hitting the roof.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>However, normal wear and tear or lack of maintenance is typically not covered by insurance. If your roof was already in poor condition before the storm, your claim may be denied.</p>
                    
                    <h4>How to File an Insurance Claim for Storm Damage</h4>
                    <p>If you suspect storm damage, follow these steps to increase your chances of a successful insurance claim:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>📝 <strong>1. Document the Damage</strong> – Take clear photos and videos of visible damage to your roof, gutters, siding, and interior ceilings (if there are leaks).</li>
                        <li>🔍 <strong>2. Schedule a Professional Roof Inspection</strong> – A certified roofing contractor can assess the extent of the damage and provide a written estimate and inspection report for your claim.</li>
                        <li>📞 <strong>3. Contact Your Insurance Provider</strong> – File a claim with your homeowners insurance company as soon as possible. Provide them with detailed documentation and your roofing contractor’s report.</li>
                        <li>🏗 <strong>4. Meet with the Insurance Adjuster</strong> – Your insurance provider will send an adjuster to inspect the damage. Having your roofer present during the inspection ensures all damage is properly documented.</li>
                        <li>💰 <strong>5. Get Your Roof Repaired or Replaced</strong> – Once your claim is approved, work with a trusted roofing company to complete the repairs.</li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <h3>How Long Do I Have to File an Insurance Claim for Storm Damage?</h3>
                    <p>The time limit to file a storm damage insurance claim varies depending on your homeowners insurance policy and state regulations, but most insurance companies allow between 6 months to 2 years to file a claim. However, acting quickly is crucial to ensure your roof damage is properly documented and covered.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Typical Deadlines for Filing a Storm Damage Insurance Claim</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>📅 <strong>Standard Filing Period:</strong> 6 months to 1 year after the storm event.</li>
                        <li>📅 <strong>Extended Deadlines in Some States:</strong> Up to 2 years, depending on your policy.</li>
                        <li>📅 <strong>Faster Filing is Recommended:</strong> The sooner you file, the better your chances of approval and full coverage.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Why You Should File a Storm Damage Claim ASAP</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🛑 <strong>Avoid Claim Denial</strong> – Waiting too long may lead your insurance company to deny the claim, arguing that the damage worsened due to neglect.</li>
                        <li>🔍 <strong>Ensure Proper Documentation</strong> – The sooner you file, the easier it is to prove the storm caused the damage rather than normal wear and tear.</li>
                        <li>💰 <strong>Maximize Your Payout</strong> – Filing quickly allows for faster claim approval and ensures full coverage for necessary roof repairs or replacements.</li>

                <div class="faq-question">Q. Do I Need a Full Roof Replacement, or Can I Just Repair the Damage? <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                <div class="faq-answer"><h3>Do I Need a Full Roof Replacement, or Can I Just Repair the Damage?</h3>
                    <p>Determining whether you need a full roof replacement or just roof repairs depends on the extent of the damage, the age of your roof, and the overall condition of your roofing materials. In many cases, minor storm damage can be repaired, but if the damage is extensive or your roof is nearing the end of its lifespan, a full replacement may be the better long-term solution.</p>
                    
                    <h4>When Can Roof Damage Be Repaired?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✅ <strong>Missing or Damaged Shingles</strong> – If only a few shingles are missing or torn due to high winds or minor hail damage, replacing them is usually sufficient.</li>
                        <li>✅ <strong>Small Leaks or Localized Damage</strong> – If a small leak is isolated to one area and hasn't caused widespread moisture damage, a targeted repair can fix the issue.</li>
                        <li>✅ <strong>Minor Flashing or Gutter Damage</strong> – Issues with flashing around chimneys, vents, or skylights can often be repaired without replacing the entire roof.</li>
                        <li>✅ <strong>Newer Roof (Under 10-15 Years Old)</strong> – If your roof is relatively new and in overall good condition, repairing isolated damage can extend its lifespan.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>When Is a Full Roof Replacement Necessary?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>❌ <strong>Widespread Shingle Damage</strong> – If large sections of your roof have missing, curling, or deteriorating shingles, repairs may not be enough.</li>
                        <li>❌ <strong>Major Leaks or Water Damage</strong> – If leaks are affecting multiple areas of your home or you see water stains inside, the underlying roof structure may be compromised.</li>
                        <li>❌ <strong>Storm or Hail Damage Across the Entire Roof</strong> – If a storm has caused severe impact damage or hail has bruised shingles across your roof, a replacement is often the best option.</li>
                        <li>❌ <strong>Roof is 20+ Years Old</strong> – Older roofs are more susceptible to damage, and replacing them now can prevent costly emergency repairs later.</li>
                        <li>❌ <strong>Structural Issues or Sagging Roof</strong> – If your roof is sagging or has significant moisture damage, a full replacement is required to maintain structural integrity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>How to Decide: Roof Repair vs. Replacement</h4>
                    <p>If you're unsure whether you need roof repairs or a full replacement, a professional roof inspection can provide a clear answer. A roofing expert will assess:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🔍 <strong>The severity of the damage</strong></li>
                        <li>📆 <strong>The age and remaining lifespan of your roof</strong></li>
                        <li>🛠 <strong>The cost-effectiveness of repairs vs. replacement</strong></li>
                        <li>🏠 <strong>Potential for future problems if only repairs are made</strong></li>
                    </ul>

        <p>"I can’t say enough good things about Denton Roofing Repairs. After a hailstorm tore up our roof, they came out the next day and gave us a fair quote. The whole process was smooth, and our new roof looks amazing!"</h4>

        <p>"Highly recommend! These guys are super professional and honest. They repaired a leak that other companies couldn’t seem to find. Haven’t had a problem since."</p>

      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>"Great service, great communication. The crew showed up on time and worked efficiently. Only reason I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because they ran a bit late finishing up, but the quality was top-notch."</p>
