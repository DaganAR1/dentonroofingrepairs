                <div class="faq-answer">How Much Does a New Roof Cost? (2024 Guide)
                  <p>The cost of a new roof varies based on several factors, including your home's size, the type of materials used, labor costs, and your location. On average, U.S. homeowners spend <strong>between $5,000 and $15,000</strong> on a roof replacement. However, complex projects may cost more.</p>
                  <h4>Key Factors That Affect Roof Replacement Costs</h4>
                  <ul>
                      <li><strong>Roofing Material:</strong> Prices vary depending on material type and quality.</li>
                      <li><strong>Roof Size & Complexity:</strong> Larger or more intricate roofs cost more.</li>
                      <li><strong>Labor Costs:</strong> Professional installation prices differ by region.</li>
                      <li><strong>Roof Removal & Disposal:</strong> Old roof removal can add extra costs.</li>
                      <li><strong>Additional Upgrades:</strong> Extra features like insulation or flashing can increase the total price.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4>Material Cost Estimates Per Square Foot (Installed):</h4>
                  <ul>

                <div class="faq-answer">  <h3>How Long Do Roofs Last? (Lifespan by Roofing Material & Maintenance Tips)</h3>
                  <p>The lifespan of a roof depends on the type of roofing material, climate conditions, and regular maintenance. On average, most roofs last <strong>15 to 50 years</strong>, but some premium materials can last even longer.</p>
                  <h4>Roof Lifespan by Material</h4>
                  <ul>
                      <li><strong>Asphalt Shingles (15 – 30 Years)</strong></li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>✔ Most common and affordable roofing material</li>
                          <li>✔ 3-tab shingles: 15 – 20 years</li>
                          <li>✔ Architectural shingles: 25 – 30 years (more durable than 3-tab)</li>
                          <li>✔ Can be affected by hail, high winds, and UV exposure</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li><strong>Metal Roofing (40 – 70 Years)</strong></li>
                      <ul>
                          <li>✔ Highly durable and weather-resistant</li>

                          <li>✔ Resistant to fire, mold, and pests</li>
                      </ul>
                  </ul>
                  <h4>Factors That Affect Roof Longevity</h4>
                  <ul>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Weather Conditions</strong> – Extreme heat, heavy rain, hail, and snow can shorten roof lifespan.</li>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Roof Ventilation</strong> – Poor ventilation can lead to moisture buildup, causing premature wear.</li>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Quality of Installation</strong> – A poorly installed roof is more prone to leaks and damage.</li>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Regular Maintenance</strong> – Cleaning debris, checking for leaks, and fixing minor issues early can extend roof life.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4>Signs That Your Roof Needs to Be Replaced</h4>
                  <ul>
                      <li>❌ Missing or curling shingles – A clear sign of wear and tear</li>
                      <li>❌ Leaks or water stains – Indicate roof damage and potential mold growth</li>
                      <li>❌ Sagging roof – A structural issue that requires immediate attention</li>
                      <li>❌ Excessive granule loss – Found in gutters, a sign of shingle deterioration</li>
                      <li>❌ High energy bills – Poor insulation and ventilation can cause energy inefficiency</li>
                  </ul>

                <div class="faq-question">Q. How will you access my roof <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                  <p>At <strong>Denton Roofing Repairs</strong>, we use safe, professional methods to access your roof for inspections, repairs, and replacements. Our trained roofing specialists follow industry best practices to ensure efficiency, safety, and minimal disruption to your property.</p>
                  
                  <h4>How We Access Your Roof</h4>
                  <p>The method we use to access your roof depends on the height, pitch, and roofing material. Here’s what you can expect:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Ladders & Safety Equipment</strong> – For most residential homes, we use secure extension ladders with stabilizers to prevent damage to gutters or siding. Our team wears harnesses and safety gear to ensure a safe inspection or repair.</li>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Roof Access Points</strong> – If your home has low-slope or flat areas, we may access your roof through a designated entry point, such as a balcony, attic access, or maintenance hatch (if applicable).</li>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Scaffolding for Steep Roofs</strong> – For high-pitch roofs or multi-story homes, we may set up scaffolding or roof jacks to safely work on steep surfaces.</li>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Drones for Roof Inspections</strong> – In some cases, we use drone technology to inspect hard-to-reach areas, especially after storm damage, hail impacts, or leaks. This allows us to assess your roof without unnecessary foot traffic, preserving the integrity of your shingles.</li>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Boom Lifts for Commercial & Multi-Story Buildings</strong> – For commercial roofing projects or taller structures, we may use boom lifts or aerial platforms for safe and efficient access.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h4>How We Ensure Your Property is Protected</h4>
                  <p>At <strong>Denton Roofing Repairs</strong>, we take every precaution to protect your home and landscaping while accessing your roof:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Ladder Stabilizers</strong> to prevent gutter or siding damage</li>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Protective Mats & Barriers</strong> to safeguard landscaping and walkways</li>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Careful Equipment Placement</strong> to avoid unnecessary weight on fragile areas</li>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Minimal Foot Traffic</strong> to extend the life of your roofing materials</li>
                  </ul>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Q. Will a new roof really increase my home’s value? <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes! A new roof can significantly increase your home’s value by improving curb appeal, energy efficiency, and overall structural integrity. Whether you’re planning to sell your home or just want to boost its long-term investment potential, replacing an old roof is one of the best home improvements for return on investment (ROI).</p>

                  <h4>How a New Roof Adds Value to Your Home</h4>
                  <p>A roof replacement offers multiple benefits that can directly impact your home’s market value:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Increases Resale Value</strong> – A new roof can boost home value by $12,000 – $15,000 on average and provides an ROI of 60% – 70%, according to Remodeling Magazine’s Cost vs. Value Report.</li>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Enhances Curb Appeal</strong> – The roof is one of the first things buyers notice. A modern, well-maintained roof makes your home look newer, cleaner, and more attractive.</li>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Improves Energy Efficiency</strong> – Upgrading to energy-efficient roofing materials (such as cool roofs, metal roofing, or high-quality asphalt shingles) can lower utility bills by improving insulation and reducing heat absorption.</li>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Reduces Insurance Costs</strong> – Many homeowners insurance companies offer discounts for impact-resistant or fire-resistant roofing materials, saving you money on premiums.</li>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Boosts Buyer Confidence</strong> – A home with a new roof is more appealing to buyers because it eliminates concerns about roof leaks, costly repairs, and structural damage.</li>
                      <li>✔ <strong>Prepares Your Home for Market</strong> – If you plan to sell, a new roof helps your home stand out in the competitive real estate market, attracting more potential buyers and even leading to faster sales.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h4>When Should You Replace Your Roof Before Selling?</h4>
                  <p>If your roof is showing signs of wear and tear, it may be a smart investment to replace it before listing your home. Here are key indicators that a new roof might be necessary:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>❌ <strong>Missing or curling shingles</strong></li>
                      <li>❌ <strong>Visible leaks or water stains on ceilings</strong></li>
                      <li>❌ <strong>Moss, mold, or algae growth</strong></li>
                      <li>❌ <strong>Sagging or uneven roof sections</strong></li>
                      <li>❌ <strong>Roof is over 20+ years old</strong></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>If you’re unsure, schedule a free roof inspection to determine whether a full roof replacement or just minor roof repairs would be the best option for increasing your home’s value.</p>

                <div class="faq-question">Q. Can I replace my own roof? <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                <div class="faq-answer"><h3>Can I Replace My Own Roof?</h3>
                  <p>Technically, yes—you can replace your own roof, but it’s not recommended unless you have extensive experience in roofing. Roof replacement is a complex, labor-intensive job that requires specialized skills, safety knowledge, and professional tools. Mistakes can lead to leaks, structural damage, and costly repairs in the long run.</p>
                  <p>If you're considering a DIY roof replacement, here’s what you need to know before making a decision.</p>
                  
                  <h4>Challenges of Replacing a Roof Yourself</h4>
                  
                  <h5>🚧 Safety Risks</h5>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Roofing is dangerous, especially if your home has a steep pitch or multiple stories.</li>
                      <li>Falls from ladders and roofs cause thousands of serious injuries every year.</li>
                      <li>Professional roofers use harnesses, stabilizers, and safety equipment to reduce risks.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h5>🛠 Lack of Proper Tools & Materials</h5>
                  <ul>
                      <li>A DIY roof replacement requires specialized roofing tools, such as pneumatic nailers, shingle cutters, and underlayment rollers.</li>
                      <li>Buying or renting this equipment can quickly increase costs.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h5>🏚 Incorrect Installation Can Lead to Leaks</h5>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Poorly installed shingles, flashing, or underlayment can cause major water damage.</li>
                      <li>Even small mistakes in sealing and ventilation can lead to mold growth, wood rot, and insulation issues.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h5>🕒 Takes Much Longer Than Expected</h5>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Professional roofers can replace a roof in 1-3 days with a trained crew.</li>
                      <li>A DIY project could take weeks, leaving your home vulnerable to the elements.</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h5>💰 May Void Manufacturer Warranties</h5>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Many roofing materials come with warranties that require professional installation.</li>
                      <li>If something goes wrong, you may lose coverage, leading to expensive repairs.</li>
                  </ul>
