                        <li>✔ Over time, UV exposure and weather changes can weaken skylight seals.</li>
                        <li>✔ Cracks in the sealant or glazing allow water to leak through.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5>🔨 5. Aging or Low-Quality Skylight Materials</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✔ Older skylights may develop cracks, condensation issues, or worn-out seals.</li>
                        <li>✔ Cheap plastic skylights tend to warp over time, creating gaps for water entry.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>How to Prevent Skylight Leaks</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✅ <strong>Ensure Proper Installation</strong> – Work with experienced professionals who use the right flashing and sealants.</li>
                        <li>✅ <strong>Regularly Inspect & Maintain Skylights</strong> – Check for loose seals, cracks, and debris buildup at least twice a year.</li>
                        <li>✅ <strong>Keep Roof & Gutters Clean</strong> – Prevent water pooling by clearing leaves and debris.</li>
                        <li>✅ <strong>Use High-Quality Skylights & Flashing</strong> – Invest in double-sealed, leak-proof designs with UV-resistant materials.</li>
                        <li>✅ <strong>Reapply Sealant When Needed</strong> – Skylight caulking may need reapplication every few years to maintain waterproofing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Are Skylight Leaks a Major Problem?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🔹 <strong>No</strong>, if properly installed and maintained, skylights should NOT leak.</li>
                        <li>🔹 <strong>Yes</strong>, if neglected, old or poorly installed skylights can develop leaks that lead to roof damage, mold growth, and costly repairs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>By choosing high-quality skylights and ensuring professional installation, you can enjoy natural light and ventilation without worrying about leaks!</p>

                <div class="faq-question">Q. How long do skylights last?<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                <div class="faq-answer"><h3>How Long Do Skylights Last?</h3>
                    <p>The lifespan of a skylight depends on the quality of materials, installation, and maintenance. On average, skylights last between 15 to 30 years before needing replacement. High-quality models with energy-efficient glazing and durable seals can last even longer with proper care.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Lifespan of Different Skylight Types</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Acrylic or Polycarbonate Skylights</strong> – 10 to 20 years (prone to yellowing or cracking over time).</li>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Tempered Glass Skylights</strong> – 20 to 30 years (more durable and impact-resistant).</li>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Laminated Glass Skylights</strong> – 25+ years (best for longevity, UV protection, and insulation).</li>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Tubular Skylights</strong> – 20+ years (small, durable, and low-maintenance).</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Factors That Affect Skylight Lifespan</h4>
                    
                    <h5>🛠 1. Quality of Installation</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✔ Poorly installed skylights are more prone to leaks and structural issues.</li>
                        <li>✔ Proper flashing and sealing extend skylight life.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5>🌞 2. Exposure to Sun & Weather</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✔ Excessive UV exposure can cause seal degradation and discoloration over time.</li>
                        <li>✔ Heavy rain, hail, or snow can wear down flashing and seals.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5>💨 3. Roof Type & Ventilation</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✔ Skylights installed on well-ventilated roofs last longer.</li>
                        <li>✔ Poor attic ventilation can cause condensation buildup, affecting seals.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h5>🔍 4. Maintenance & Inspections</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✔ Cleaning debris and checking seals & flashing helps prevent leaks.</li>
                        <li>✔ Reapplying sealant every 10–15 years can extend lifespan.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Signs It’s Time to Replace a Skylight</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>❌ Visible cracks, fogging, or discoloration in the glass.</li>
                        <li>❌ Water leaks or mold growth around the skylight.</li>
                        <li>❌ Drafts or temperature fluctuations near the skylight.</li>
                        <li>❌ Warped or damaged flashing that can’t be resealed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Can Skylights Last Longer Than 30 Years?</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✔ Yes, if properly maintained and made with high-quality materials.</li>
                        <li>✔ No, if exposed to harsh weather, poor ventilation, or neglected maintenance.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Regular inspections, cleaning, and sealant touch-ups help ensure your skylight remains leak-free and functional for decades!</p>
