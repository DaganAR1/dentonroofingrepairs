            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Q. What is roof coating, and how does it work?<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                <div class="faq-answer"><h3>What Is Roof Coating, and How Does It Work?</h3>
                    <p>Roof coating is a protective layer applied to your roof to enhance durability, improve energy efficiency, and extend its lifespan. This seamless, waterproof barrier helps protect against UV rays, water damage, and harsh weather conditions while reducing maintenance costs. Roof coatings are commonly used on flat and low-slope roofs, but they can also benefit some metal and asphalt shingle roofs.</p>
                    
                    <h4>How Does Roof Coating Work?</h4>
                    <p>Roof coatings create a seamless, weatherproof membrane over the roof’s surface, preventing leaks, cracks, and deterioration. The coating is typically applied in liquid form and hardens into a flexible, durable layer that helps maintain the roof’s integrity.</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>🔹 <strong>Step 1: Roof Inspection & Cleaning</strong> – The roof must be thoroughly cleaned and inspected to remove dirt, debris, and any loose material before coating application.</li>
                        <li>🔹 <strong>Step 2: Application of Roof Coating</strong> – The coating is applied in multiple layers using a sprayer, brush, or roller, ensuring even coverage.</li>
                        <li>🔹 <strong>Step 3: Curing & Sealing</strong> – Once applied, the coating dries and bonds to the existing roof material, forming a seamless, waterproof barrier.</li>
                        <li>🔹 <strong>Step 4: Long-Term Protection</strong> – The final result is a durable, reflective, and weather-resistant surface that helps reduce energy costs and extend the roof’s lifespan.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Benefits of Roof Coating</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>☀️ <strong>Extends Roof Lifespan</strong> – Adds 10–20 years to your roof by preventing wear and tear.</li>
                        <li>🌧 <strong>Waterproofs & Prevents Leaks</strong> – Creates a watertight seal to prevent moisture penetration.</li>
                        <li>🔥 <strong>Reflects UV Rays & Lowers Energy Costs</strong> – Helps reduce indoor temperatures, cutting cooling expenses.</li>
                        <li>🛠 <strong>Reduces Maintenance & Repairs</strong> – Protects against cracks, blisters, and weather damage.</li>
                        <li>🏗 <strong>Works on Various Roofing Materials</strong> – Suitable for flat, metal, TPO, EPDM, and asphalt roofs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Types of Roof Coatings</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Acrylic Roof Coatings</strong> – Best for UV protection and mild climates.</li>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Silicone Roof Coatings</strong> – Ideal for waterproofing and heavy rain-prone areas.</li>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Polyurethane Roof Coatings</strong> – Highly durable and impact-resistant.</li>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Asphalt-Based Roof Coatings</strong> – Commonly used for low-slope roofs.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Is Roof Coating Right for Your Roof?</h4>
                    <p>Roof coatings are a cost-effective alternative to full roof replacement for buildings with minor wear and aging. If your roof is still structurally sound but showing signs of wear, a roof coating can restore and protect it for years to come.</p>                                      
</div>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
                <div class="faq-question">Q. How long does a roof coating last?<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                <div class="faq-answer"> <h3>How Long Does a Roof Coating Last?</h3>
                    <p>A properly applied roof coating can last between <strong>10 to 20 years</strong>, depending on the type of coating, roof material, climate conditions, and maintenance. Roof coatings help extend the lifespan of your roof by providing a protective, waterproof barrier, reducing wear from UV rays, weather, and debris.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Lifespan of Different Roof Coating Types</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Acrylic Roof Coatings</strong> – 10–15 years (Best for UV protection and reflective properties.)</li>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Silicone Roof Coatings</strong> – 15–20 years (Highly durable and excellent for waterproofing in wet climates.)</li>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Polyurethane Roof Coatings</strong> – 10–20 years (Impact-resistant and ideal for high-traffic roofs.)</li>
                        <li>✔ <strong>Asphalt-Based Roof Coatings</strong> – 10–15 years (Common for flat or low-slope roofs, offering good weather resistance.)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Factors That Affect Roof Coating Longevity</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>✅ <strong>Type & Quality of Coating</strong> – High-performance coatings like silicone and polyurethane last longer than standard acrylic or asphalt coatings.</li>
                        <li>✅ <strong>Roof Condition Before Application</strong> – A well-prepared, clean, and structurally sound roof ensures better adhesion and durability.</li>
                        <li>✅ <strong>Climate & Weather Conditions</strong> – Extreme heat, heavy rain, hail, and high winds can wear down coatings faster.</li>
                        <li>✅ <strong>Thickness of Application</strong> – A properly applied, thick coat increases protection and lifespan.</li>
                        <li>✅ <strong>Maintenance & Recoating</strong> – Regular inspections and reapplying a fresh coat every 10–15 years can extend the coating’s longevity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Can You Recoat a Roof to Extend Its Lifespan?</h4>
                    <p>Yes! Many roof coatings can be reapplied over existing coatings, adding another <strong>10–20 years</strong> of protection without needing a full roof replacement. Regular maintenance and timely recoating maximize roof performance and prevent leaks or deterioration.</p>                                       
                    </div>

                <div class="faq-question">Q.  Can a roof coating stop leaks?<i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                <div class="faq-answer"><h3>Can a Roof Coating Stop Leaks?</h3>
                    <p>Yes, roof coatings can stop minor leaks and prevent future water damage, but they are most effective as a preventative solution rather than a repair for major structural issues. Roof coatings create a seamless, waterproof barrier that seals small cracks, gaps, and weak areas, helping to prevent leaks before they start. However, if your roof has significant damage, large holes, or structural problems, repairs may be needed before applying a coating.</p>
                    
                    <h4>How Roof Coatings Help Prevent & Stop Leaks</h4>
                    
                    <h5>🌧 1. Creates a Seamless, Waterproof Layer</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Roof coatings seal small cracks and gaps, preventing water from seeping into the roof structure.</li>
                        <li>Unlike shingles or seams, coatings provide continuous protection without weak spots.</li>

If you’re considering a roof coating project, timing and weather conditions play a crucial role in the final results.</p>

        <p>"Great service, great communication. The crew showed up on time and worked efficiently. Only reason I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because they ran a bit late finishing up, but the quality was top-notch."</p>
